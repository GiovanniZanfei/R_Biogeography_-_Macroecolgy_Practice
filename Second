### Install "vegan" R package from Oksanen and colleagues
### "vegan" manual -> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vegan.pdf
### "vegan" diversity vignette -> https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/vegan/vignettes/diversity-vegan.pdf
install.packages("vegan")

### Load the package (REMEMBER: you install the package once,
### and you load it every time you start a new session!)
library(vegan)

### Load biomac_1 dataset
dat <- read.csv("Data/data_biomac_1.csv")
dat

### Inspect the first six rows of the first five columns
head(dat[, 1:5])
dat[1:6, 1:5] # this is equivalent to the former line

dim(dat) # check data.frame dimensions (1st rows, 2nd columns)
tail(dat[, 1:5]) # inspect the last six rows of the first five columns
dat[14:19, 1:5]

str(dat) # check data structure

### Now we're going to extract the actual community "matrix" from "dat"
comm <- dat[, -1]

### Calculate species richness (alpha diversity) per site
comm[1:5, 1:5] # 5 rows and columns
comm[1:5, 1:5] > 0 # from coverage values to presence absence (TRUE = presence, FALSE = absence)
rowSums(comm[1:5, 1:5] > 0) # calculate species richness per site (limited to first 5 rows and columns)
rowSums(comm > 0) # the actual value
specnumber(comm) # a dedicated function (to calculate species richness)
hist(specnumber(comm),
     xlab = "Species richness",
     main = NULL)

### Exercise 1: calculate Shannon's H for each site
#diversity(comm)

### Calculate species frequency
colSums(comm > 0) # as for calculating species richness, we only need to "change direction"
specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2) # specnumber also calculates species frequency by adding "MARGIN = 2" argument
sort(specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2)) # species by their frequencies
sort(specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2), decreasing = T) # the same in decreasing order

### Exercise 1: make an histogram of species frequencies
#hist(specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2), xlab = "Species frequency", main = NULL, breaks = 1:25)

### Exercise 2: using functions you're learned up to know find the 6 most frequent species
#head(sort(specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2), decreasing = T))

### Exercise 3: calculate how many species occur only once (to sum values you can use the sum() function)
#sum(specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2) == 1)

### Exercise 4: list all species occurring only once ("For species is common to be rare") -> check the names() and/or which() function
#names(comm)[specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2) == 1]
#which(specnumber(comm, MARGIN = 2) == 1)

### Transform coverage values into presence/absence
comm_pa <- decostand(comm, method = "pa")
head(comm_pa[1:10])

### Split dataset into two subsets and calculate gamma diversity per subset
groups <- c(rep(1, 10),
            rep(2, 9))
specnumber(comm, groups)

### Gamma diversity for the total dataset (it should be equal to ncol(dat) if all species are actually present)
groups_gamma <- rep(1, 19)
specnumber(comm, groups_gamma)
